//1) what is promise and why do we need it.

// promise is a concept in a JS which gives us to handle a async function. promice has three states (resolve,reject,pending). and we can handle this states by try and catch or by async await.JS

// before promises we use callback function. callback functions are difficult to debug , difficult to Read. and make a problem as a calback hell. callback hell also called as pyaramid doom.JS

// Promises help us to solve code easy, cleaner, more readable.


// 2) what is callback hell??

// Callback hell is when you have many nested callbacks, making your code hard to read.
